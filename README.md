# JPGtoPNGConverter-Python
I coded a mini project which took a few JPEG images from the web converted them into PNG images using python. I used the PIL module and the OS module for my code as this gives the ability to also edit the new updated png images which can be highly useful in many web applications ( Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat) to make filters and resize edits.
